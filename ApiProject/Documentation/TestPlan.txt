Test Plan
The broken hashserve application testing approach should be automation 
with BDD approach for better test case visibility and reusability of each step.
Testing would require to test each feature independenly and as a flow 
as the endpoints are dependent on each other in some cases.
Tools:
Manual API testing can be done in Postman. 
Automation API testing: pactumJS. It is a lightweight REST API testing 
tool that has all the capabilities we need.

Risks: PactumJS needs a proof of concept for automated server launching capability.
Requirment list can be added with additional points as some 
criteria is unclear how to reproduce.
